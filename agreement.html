			<h1>RELEASE WAIVER</h1></b><br>
			***Every adult is required to fill out a Release Waiver before attending a church service FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLY. Parents with children under 18 can include their child(ren)'s names.***<br><br>

			Kingston Chinese Alliance Church ("KCAC") has put precautions in place to reduce the spread of COVID-19; however, KCAC cannot guarantee that you or your family, including your child(ren), will not become exposed to or infected with COVID-19.<br>
			Further, because of the number of individuals involved in church services and the fact that many infected individuals appear to be asymptomatic, attending these activities could increase your and your child(ren)‚Äôs risk of contracting COVID-19.
<br><br>
			By signing this waiver, I acknowledge the contagious nature of COVID-19 and voluntarily assume the risk that my child(ren) and I may be exposed to or infected by COVID-19. I also acknowledge that by attending church services, such exposure or infection may result in personal injury, illness, disability, and/or death. I understand that the risk of becoming exposed to or infected by COVID-19 at church services may result from the actions, omissions, or negligence of myself and others, including, but not limited to, KCAC employees, contractors, volunteers, members, and participants and their families.<br><br>

			As COVID-19 is highly contagious and is known to spread mainly from person-to-person contact, by attending events at KCAC, I agree to abide by the procedures established by KCAC to protect attendees and staff, and I voluntarily assume the risk that I and/or my family may be exposed to or infected by COVID-19 at KCAC services.  I agree to assume all the risks of attendance and participation for myself and my family, and I waive any liability against KCAC.<br><br>

			I voluntarily agree to assume all of the foregoing risks and accept sole responsibility for any injury to my child(ren) or myself (including, but not limited to, personal injury, disability, and death), illness, damage, loss, claim, liability, or expense of any kind that I or my child(ren) may experience or incur in connection with our attendance at KCAC services (‚ÄúClaims‚Äù).<br><br>

			On my behalf, and on behalf of my children, I hereby release, discharge hold harmless and covenant not to sue KCAC, its employees, agents, and representatives, of and from the Claims, including all liabilities, claims, actions, damages, costs or expenses of any kind arising out of or relating thereto. I understand and agree that this release includes any Claims based on the actions, omissions, or negligence of KCAC, its employees, agents, and representatives, whether a COVID-19 infection occurs before, during, or after participation in any program.<br>
