          ><h1>RELEASE WAIVER<br />免责声明</h1></b
        ><br />
        ***Every adult is required to fill out a Release Waiver before attending
        a church service FOR THE FIRST TIME ONLY. Parents with children under 18
        can include their child(ren)'s names.***<br /><br />

        Kingston Chinese Alliance Church ("KCAC") has put precautions in place
        to reduce the spread of COVID-19; however, KCAC cannot guarantee that
        you or your family, including your child(ren), will not become exposed
        to or infected with COVID-19.<br />
        Further, because of the number of individuals involved in church
        services and the fact that many infected individuals appear to be
        asymptomatic, attending these activities could increase your and your
        child(ren)’s risk of contracting COVID-19.
        <br /><br />
        By signing this waiver, I acknowledge the contagious nature of COVID-19
        and voluntarily assume the risk that my child(ren) and I may be exposed
        to or infected by COVID-19. I also acknowledge that by attending church
        services, such exposure or infection may result in personal injury,
        illness, disability, and/or death. I understand that the risk of
        becoming exposed to or infected by COVID-19 at church services may
        result from the actions, omissions, or negligence of myself and others,
        including, but not limited to, KCAC employees, contractors, volunteers,
        members, and participants and their families.<br /><br />

        As COVID-19 is highly contagious and is known to spread mainly from
        person-to-person contact, by attending events at KCAC, I agree to abide
        by the procedures established by KCAC to protect attendees and staff,
        and I voluntarily assume the risk that I and/or my family may be exposed
        to or infected by COVID-19 at KCAC services. I agree to assume all the
        risks of attendance and participation for myself and my family, and I
        waive any liability against KCAC.<br /><br />

        I voluntarily agree to assume all of the foregoing risks and accept sole
        responsibility for any injury to my child(ren) or myself (including, but
        not limited to, personal injury, disability, and death), illness,
        damage, loss, claim, liability, or expense of any kind that I or my
        child(ren) may experience or incur in connection with our attendance at
        KCAC services (“Claims”).<br /><br />

        On my behalf, and on behalf of my children, I hereby release, discharge
        hold harmless and covenant not to sue KCAC, its employees, agents, and
        representatives, of and from the Claims, including all liabilities,
        claims, actions, damages, costs or expenses of any kind arising out of
        or relating thereto. I understand and agree that this release includes
        any Claims based on the actions, omissions, or negligence of KCAC, its
        employees, agents, and representatives, whether a COVID-19 infection
        occurs before, during, or after participation in any program.<br /><br />

        ***教会要求每位成年人填写免责声明（只在第一次参加崇拜时要求填写）。父母可以将18岁以下孩子包括在本人的免责声明中***<br /><br />

        京士顿华人宣道会（“KCAC")
        尽力采取各样措施预防新冠病毒的传播。然而，KCAC无法完全确保您和您的家人不受新冠病毒的威胁/传染。因为很多新冠病毒感染者没有患病症状，因此，参加主日崇拜可能会增加感染新冠病毒的危险。<br /><br />

        本人在此签署免责声明，我理解新冠病毒的传染特性，自愿承担本人和子女感染新冠病毒的风险。我确知参加教会敬拜而感染新冠病毒可能会造成身体损伤，疾病，残疾或死亡。我确知感染新冠病毒的风险可能来自本人或他人（包括KCAC同工，承包商，义工，教会会友，慕道友和他们的家人）的行为，疏忽或过失。<br /><br />

        鉴于新冠病毒的易感染性和接触感染特性，本人同意参加KCAC聚会时遵守KCAC制定的各项预防措施，本人自愿承担本人和子女参加KCAC敬拜时感染新冠病毒的风险。我同意承担本人及子女参加聚会的风险。我声明免除KCAC所有新冠病毒有关责任。<br /><br />

        我自愿同意承担所有以上风险，接受任何对本人及子女的因参加KCAC聚会而造成相关的任何伤害（包括身体损伤，残疾或死亡），疾病，损伤，损失，赔偿，责任和费用等全权负责。<br />
        <br />
        在此我代表本人及子女免除对KCAC责任，不会起诉KCAC及其同工，代理人和代表任何赔偿，包括所有相关责任，赔偿，诉讼，损失和费用。我理解和同意此免责包括任何对因KCAC及其同工，代理人和代表的行为，疏忽和失误造成的聚会前后时的新冠病毒感染。<br /><br />
