        <br />
        If you are fully vaccinated (it has been 14 or more days since your

        answer is “No.”<br /><br />
        3. In the last 14 days, have you travelled outside of Canada and been
        told to quarantine (per the federal quarantine requirements)?

        4. In the last 14 days, have you been identified as a “close contact” of
        someone who currently has COVID-19? <br />
        If public health has advised you that you do not need to self-isolate
