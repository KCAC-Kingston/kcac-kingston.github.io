			  content="As a church, we exist to share the gospel. We support all people through membership into the church body and shape them to be imitators of Christ. In everything, we serve others with our gifts so that the glory of God will shine. Our dream is to see you: Become a member of our family. Become a model of Christ’s character. Become a minister of His grace. Become a messenger of His love. Become a magnifier of His name. This is a process that we are committed to leading you through. You are in Kingston for a reason. You are not just a passerby, not just here for an education. God has a unique purpose for your time here and has given you talents and gifts that can be used to serve Him! We are not a typical Chinese church. Our English congregation is led by students for students targeted specifically towards students! We are a purpose driven church committed to training, equipping and sending."

						<h2>KCAC Rocky Railway VBS Summer 2022 Camper </h2>
						<p><br />
							Welcome to "Rocky Railway VBS: Jesus' power pulls us through" at Kingston Chinese Alliance Church!
							 <blockquote>The camp is for children ages 4-12 (entering into kindergarten and entering into grade 6) and will be run from Monday, 
								 August 15 to Friday, August 19 2022, 9:00am to 4:00pm each day.</blockquote>
								 <br> <img class="image left" src="images/vbs.jpeg"><br>
At Rocky Railway, kids discover through life’s ups and downs that Jesus’ power pulls us through. 
Kids participate in memorable Bible-learning activities, sing catchy songs, play teamwork-building games, 
engage in fun snack-eating experiences, take part in one-of-a-kind Bible Adventures; 
a week full of memories and songs that will last them a lifetime! 
Plus, kids will learn to look for evidence of God all around them through something called God Sightings. 
Each day concludes with the Rocky Wrap-Up that gets everyone involved in living what they’ve learned.
